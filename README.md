# Library-management-system
Python project - Library management system
 This is a Python project that emphasizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In this system, users (students or the general public) can borrow books, return them, donate new books, and keep track of the ones currently checked out. It's a perfect beginner-level project to practice and understand key OOP concepts, as it involves handling real-world scenarios like managing book inventories and user transactions in a library.
